Michelle Mengxi Li


###Overview

The aim of this course project is to demonstrate the ability to obtain and clean a data set so that it can be used for subsequent analyses

The source data for this project can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

###Making Modifications to This Script

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the source files, you will need to set the path of the working directory to relect the location of the source files in your own directory.

###Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
